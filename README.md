# Mission-Demolition
Implementation of "Mission Demoltion" game from Gibson/Bond Unity Book

Same deal as HW #2. We're going to implement a chapter in the Gibson/Bond text and then extend it. This time we'll implement the second tutorial -- Chapter 29, Prototype 2: Mission Demolition. The game is a rip on Angry Birds.

Wait a minute, is Burns simply going to use the Gibson/Bond the entire semester for the individual homeworks? We'll see. Out of all the tutorials, examples, demos that I've seen on Unity, I'm really happy with many of the the Gibson/Bond examples. (This also might be a reflection on my personal perference of learning from texts rather than official and unofficial Unity tutorial videos.)

Specifically, what I really like about this tutorial is the introduction of the following concepts: the OnMouseEnter and OnMouseExit triggers, the Halo effect, the SetActive method, vector math (!!!!), the Lerp() function, Vector2's, the Line Rendered effect, ....

We won't be able to introduce and discuss every Unity concept during lecture; a secondary goal of this assignment is to increase your comfort level in reading outside Unity tutorials and querying for troubleshooting.
